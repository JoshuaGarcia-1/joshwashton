- 👋 Hi, I’m @joshwashton
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how do to the things that I currently don't know how to do (i.e coding).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much everything I can attempt at understanding (Python for the most part)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, if you're willing to put me in your team that is.
- 📫 How to reach me: through here, though I cannot guarantee that I'll see your message for 5-10 business weeks. Or through e-mail, which is much more reliable (g.joshua1206@gmail.com)
